# 1000 genomes uniparental isodisomy identification
* These samples were mostly identified with a semi-automated pipeline, backed up by manual curation 
* A more robust pipeline is in the works, but we are including these as they are good examples for testing. This may not be a comprehensive list of UPDs and mosaic UPDs in this cohort.
