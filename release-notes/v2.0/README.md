## Overview
We took Structural Variant (SV) calls from multiple resources. To benchmark these calls, we test Mendelian consistency in trio families and Platinum Genome pedigree, and also test for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in a population of unrelated individuals.

The final output of our benchmark data is in VCF format. Variants that pass our all tests were labeled as *PASS* in their filter fields.

Variants that fail one or more test were labled with the specific filter name(s) in their filter fields. These variants may be:

- False positive calls
- True variants but:
    - Have inaccurate breakpoints and/or erroneous insertion sequences
    - Lie in tandem repeat region
    - Have population-unstable breakpoints

### Genome Version
Original calls and validation were performed on hg38. hg19 VCF is generated by liftover. 12% variants were not lifted to hg19.

### **Source of the calls**

The original SV calls come from:

- Manta calls from short-read data of Platinum Genome
- Refined Sniffles calls from [Sedlazeck et al. 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0001-7)
- Calls from the Ashkenazi son in [Genome in a Bottle](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/genome-bottle)

In the release VCF, the *SOURCE* keys in *INFO* fields indicate which dataset(s) a variant was originally called.

### **Samples genotyped in truth data**

The release VCF contains genotypes of:

- Parents and grandparents in the [Platinum Genome pedigree](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/gr.210500.116)
- NIST Ashkenazi trio from [Genome in a Bottle](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/genome-bottle)
- 50 trio families in Polaris sequencing resources
