## Overview

A **hg38** truth set of simple deletion and insertions built from:
    
- Manta deletion and insertion calls from NovaSeq NA12877 & NA12878 (NSV4 pipeline on hg38)
    - This part of is the same as in v0.5 (except for minor VCF format fix)

- Refined Sniffles (v1.0.8) deletion and insertion calls from PacBio NA12878 on hg38
    - Insertion sequence was assembled and refined from PacBio + ONT reads

- copy number variants and large deletions curated from population and Platinum Genome pedigree on *hg19*, coming from deletion calls of Manta/Canvas and Sniffles.
    - Please see Xiao's CNV truth set repository for details:
        - https://git.illumina.com/xchen2/CNVTruthSet

Hg19 truth set is generated by lift-over on hg38 truth set.

12,374 (98%) passed entries and 24,405 (88%) failed entries were successfully converted to hg19.

The release vcf contains genotypes of NA12877 and NA12878 (re-genotyped with our targeted graph genotyper *Paragraph*).

Illumina cluster users can find VCF containing full Platinum Genome pedigree genotypes on Illumina cluster.

### Unvalidated variants

In addition, VCFs named with "all_merge.include_unvalidated" contain unvalidated variants from Sniffles v1.0.8 calls, they are:

- All calls on chrX, chrY and mitochondria

- Inversions, duplications and translocations

These unvalidated variants are labled as *UNVALIDATED* in their filter fields.

For now we haven't established a robust pipeine for validating these variants, but finally they will be validated in future release.

### Data format

Variants that pass our pedigree and population check were labeled as *PASS* in their filter fields.

Variants that fail any filter were labled with the specific filter name(s) in their filter fields.

*SOURCE* key in *INFO* field indicates where the variant originally comes from. All unvalidated variants do not have *SOURCE* key because they all come from Sniffles.

Using refined Sniffles calls as input, v0.6 has a significant improved validate rate for Sniffles calls, with 2,604 validated insertions and a validation rate of 26%, compared to v0.5 (589 validated insertions and a validation rate of 5%).

## Merging Scheme

For simple SVs validated by Paragraph, we followed the same merging scheme for deletions as [v0.5](../v0.5/README.md).

For CNVs, we do not try to merge them with simple SVs.

For large deletions labeled as PASS, we prioritize Paragraph validated ones over Xiao's CNV truth set.
